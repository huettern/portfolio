## Zynq from scratch
My curiousity for the Xilinx Zynq devices got woken when I got a RedPitaya board from my father. 
The RedPitaya board is a open-source hardware project intended to replace expensive lab equipment.
Its core piece is a Xilinx Zynw SoC with dual core ARM processor and FPGA logic. 
Installing the prebuilt image was too easy for me so I started to build some simple applications "from scratch", meaning without prewritten software.
In this blog I itend to write down the knowledge I have gained during the development with the RedPitaya board.

### Processing System
These posts show bare metal projects using the processing system.

### Programmable logic
These posts show bare metal projects using the programmable logic, the FPGA part of the SoC.

Posts to come.

### Linux on Zynq
Running Linux on the SoC opens a range of opportunities.
These posts show how to run Linux on the Zynq.
