      <description>Abstract In the world of self-driving cars and virtual reality games it is becoming increasingly important to represent digitally what we see. Therefore, using high resolution cameras, images of the environment have been recorded. These large images are processed to be presented three dimensionally. This image processing task needs to be accelerated to get a fast work flow. A dedicated hardware approach using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) was implemented that is scalable onto multiple FPGAs.</description>

      <description>Abstract Based on a simulation and multiple research papers I implemented a PI control algorithm and a complex PWM modulator in FPGA fabric and CPU to control a high power converter. The result are two IP cores that are controlled over an AXI4Lite interface by the CPU, both with PWM modulators, one having a PI controller built in and the other multi channel ADC support. A low level C driver can be used to communicate with the cores from the ARM CPU on the Zynq SoC.</description>
